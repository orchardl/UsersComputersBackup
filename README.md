# UsersComputersBackup
I was tired of being asked who was the last person to use a specific machine, or vice versa. 
This generally isn't a big deal, but sometimes if we lost communication with the machine, 
I wanted to have a history of everyone who has ever logged into that machine. 
Every day, a few files are automatically dropped in a specific folder, 
and this script will run on that folder and appropriately log the changees.
